One of the main reasons ensemble learning is so effective is because it reduces the overall
risk of making a poor model selection. This enables it to train in a diverse manner and then
perform well on unknown data. When we build a model using ensemble learning, the
individual models need to exhibit some diversity. This would allow them to capture
various nuances in our data; hence the overall model becomes more accurate.
